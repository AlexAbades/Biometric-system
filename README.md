Introduction to Biometric Systems


- Function that selects Image to make the morphing based on a threshold. Should be able to select x morphing and y subjects.

- Morphing of selected images. 

- Create a subdata set that includes the images that has been selected for the morphing and the other images from the same subject on the reference folder. Has to create 2 datasets of embeding distances, one dataset has to be a list of the embeding distances of the different photos of the same subjects, the other dataset has to be the embeding distances from the photos that are not the same subject.
